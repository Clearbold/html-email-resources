<!-- For Comcast (?) / Google apps (?) / Outlook / responsiveness, I've gotten in the habit of setting
        full-width responsive images to have a 100% width inline style (in addition to hybrid,
        mobile-first MQs and setting width/height attributes to squeeze @1.5x or @2x images down). -->
<img src="#" alt="" width="600" style="height: auto; width: 100%;" />
<!-- From the @id attribute to the styles, any of this might be useful in shoring up images.
        This was copied from a full-width image I've struggled with getting to fill its parent cell
        in Win 10 Mail. -->
<img id=”OWATemporaryImageDivContainer” class="decorative" src="#" width="650" height="310" alt="" style="border: 0 !important; display: block; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;" />
