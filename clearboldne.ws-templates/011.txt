" But now the explosion of people accessing the web through mobile devices has forced us to come to terms with the ways that the web is different. Our shared hallucination that we have control over layout and presentation, that most users on the desktop had essentially the same screen size, the same input devices--that's gone. "

DESIGN & DEV TOOLS

Atomic Design

Taking on pattern libraries and front-end frameworks, Brad Frost drops a bomb on the current landscape with his Pattern Lab and Atomic Design: "a methodology for building an effective design system."

Pure

In its ongoing quest for relevancy, Yahoo! unleashes yet another front-end framework. I like Pure's focus on small modules that can be easily adopted without the entirety of a larger framework and with less imposing design elements.
