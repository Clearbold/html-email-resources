2012 in Numbers

Did you know that Mail for iOS was the most popular email client in 2012?

Did you know that 59% of global mobile data traffic was video?

That 31% of the U.S. Internet population used a tablet or e-reader?

Or that the average web page became 35% larger and 4% slower to load in 2012? (While users' patience and attention continue to diminish.)

Pingdom has compiled all of these 2012 stats - and more - in one place.

===> An Academic Discussion of Carousels

Erik Runyon looks at analytics data for Notre Dame's sites and uncovers greatly diminishing returns on slides beyond the 1st position.
http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/carousel-stats/

Brad Frost follows up with an opinionated post - Do carousels actually annoy users and take attention away from the featured content area? Is any value that's gained worth the impact on performance and added complexity?
