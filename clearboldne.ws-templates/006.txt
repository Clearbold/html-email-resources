The Devices Issue

With the normalization of the smartphone behind us, and widespread Web-enabled TVs, cars and refrigerators right around the corner, let's catch up on keeping up with our devices.

Google Announces Chromebook Pixel

I'm in agreement: At $1,300 and with Chrome OS's limitations, the Chromebook Pixel is an impractical buy. What is noteworthy is that this laptop has the "highest-resolution screen on the market" and a touch-enabled screen. Along with the Microsoft Surface, the distinction between touch-enabled mobile devices and traditional laptops has been obliterated. Every screen now has the potential to be a touch-enabled screen, and that impacts how we design for the Web.

The Wirecutter: The Chromebook Pixel is not for you
http://bit.ly/YwtaSL

What intrigues me more in the Chromebook lineup is the $250 Samsung model. I could see myself buying this for members of my family. It does web browsing, including Facebook, video chat, online games, Google Docs and web-based email. With Chrome's rapid ascent as a web browser, Chrome OS is a more familiar environment to many than Windows 8, and may have more long-term potential.

As mobile devices become more utility than novelty, I find Google's Nexus 7, running the latest Android OS, in my hands more than my iPhone 4 or iPad. It accomplishes much of anything I commonly do on either device, though it's not as sturdy or polished. I've had an iPhone since its 2007 debut. We have 3 Macs in our household, 2 iPhones in use and an iPad. My 11" MacBook Air is the best computer I've ever owned. There's lots of room for evolution in this space, though.

Google Glass Takes Step Forward

Google also made recent news with the launch of a new microsite for its Glass project, featuring a video consisting largely of...People recording video? So far, I'm largely in agreement with John Gruber on Daring Fireball: It's something "I personally have no need for." I'm also reminded of Patrick Rhone's post on putting down the camera.

How to get one? Google has an application process to be able to pre-order a device for $1500 (plus tax!), if you pass the audition.

Counting Tablets as PCs, Apple is #1

According to market researchers at Canalys, with one in six PCs shipped in Q4 2012 being an iPad, Apple is the top PC maker.

Device Boundaries Blurring

If you've assumed that a smartphone will always be palm-sized and navigable with a thumb, or that touch is good for tablet-sized devices down and hover states are good for laptop-sized devices and up, you'll start to see those lines blurring as users hook keyboards up to their tablets and the Surface Pro works as a touchscreen laptop.

Luke Wroblewski: "A complete continuum of screen sizes is actually a blessing for Web designers and developers. It forces us toward adaptive solutions that respond to diverse capabilities instead of being able to draw arbitrary cut-off points for separate mobile, tablet, and desktop sites."

Android & iOS... What About Windows? Blackberry? Firefox?

Windows Phone's market share continues to be anemic. Is there any hope at this point?

Final Q4 Numbers and Full Year 2012 Stats for Smartphone Market Shares
http://bit.ly/Y3jAZv

With the Surface RT targeting tablets like the iPad, and the Surface Pro offering full access to Windows 8 in tablet form, Microsoft is hedging its bets. Without sales numbers, it's hard to tell whether the Surface will take off.

We'll hear about Blackberry 10, Firefox OS, Ubuntu and others in 2013. They have a steep climb ahead, but may be contenders if we look at the global, non-US market.
