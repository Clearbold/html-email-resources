===> The Prototyping Issue

Prototyping is scary. It upends the Waterfall process we've long relied on for project management, where Discovery begets Wireframes which beget Design comps which are handed off to be sliced and coded in Development. Waterfall allows us to work in discrete phases. Doing otherwise means we not only have to more tightly coordinate our schedules, but also the ways in which we work.

Prototyping is fast becoming a necessity, though. Static wireframes or comps can't show a client how a page will adapt to a tablet, handheld device, desktop monitor or, most importantly, points in-between. It's those unknown dimensions lying in wait in the future that we need to cover, so that our launch isn't DOA.

Prototyping also allows us to fail early and fail cheap. An interface element might look great in a static, polished comp, and then fall flat once it's built and used. Tackling those ideas early in rough prototypes provides room for discussion before commitments--time & budget--are made.

===> App.net Meets Funding Goal

If you're not paying for something, you're the product; Not the customer.

Twitter needs a profitable business model, and so they've begun working on services that will provide value to their customers: Advertisers. Changes to Twitter's stream to include Promoted Tweets and enhanced media not only impact its users, but also third-party applications that many of us rely on for an optimized Twitter experience. There is growing concern that Twitter will move in a direction that will effectively shut down third-party apps.

Thousands of backers helped App.net reach its $500,000 goal to fund development of a social networking platform that is user-driven, not advertiser-driven. An alpha of the platform has already been released and backers have begun trying it out.
