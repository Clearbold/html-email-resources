### CSS (or lack thereof)

* [Bulletproof Email Background Images](http://emailbg.net/)
  * This technique (and tool to generate the necessary code) works, but Outlook 2007, 2010 and 2013 fall apart when you put two tables over the background image with `align=left` & `align=right`, which is a popular technique for responsive email design.

### Delivery Platforms - Self-hosted

### Delivery Platforms - Third-party

### Pre-flight - Inline CSS generators
  
### Responsive Email Design

### Testing

* [Litmus](https://litmus.com/)
  * Litmus's virtual testing tools power those of many other platforms. For a while I've paid one-off fees to Campaign Monitor for access to email client screenshots. You get a lot more functionality working with Litmus directly, including the ability to live edit your code and refresh tests in supported email clients.
